        <p style="text-align: ;justify"><em4>Modern human life is greatly influenced by computers. 
           Programming has become an integral part of all the devices 
           we use in our daily lives. 
           Big tech manufacturers are deploying programming to promote 
           and organization in business operations. 
           They are of great importance as they allow for generating recurring 
           and systematic tasks. 
           Here, we have listed the some of the top programming languages.

                <ul>
                    <li>Python is a general-purpose programming language 
                        that can be used on any modern computer operating system. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can be used for processing text, numbers, images,
                        scientific data and just about anything else you might 
                        save on a computer. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <font></font> It is used daily in the operations of the Google search 
                        engine, the video-sharing website YouTube, NASA and 
                        the New York Stock Exchange.

                    <h4>There are three main components of the Java programming 
                        language:

                        <b>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</b><br> 
                        JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to
                        drive the Java code or applications.
                        It is the center of the programming language and 
                        performs the operation of converting Java bytecode into machine language.
                        It provides numerous libraries, frameworks, and tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</b><br>
                        JRE is a runtime environment that is required to execute Java programs and applications.
                        If a user wants to run a Java program in their machine, 
                        they must have JRE installed on the machine. 
                        It’s platform dependent, meaning the JRE installed must be compatible 
                        with the user’s operating system and architecture.                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Java Development Kit (JDK):</b><br> 
                        JDK is the core component of the Java environment.
                        It contains JRE along with Java compiler, Java debugger, and other classes. 
                        It’s used for Java development to provide the entire executables and 
                        binaries as well as the tools to compile and debug a Java program.
